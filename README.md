# Daggerverse

See [daggerverse.dev](https://daggerverse.dev/) for more information.

My own set of [Dagger](https://dagger.io/) modules.

* [JFrog CLI](./jfrog-cli) and [Artifactory](./artifactory) to interact with Artifactory.
* [Git Changelog](./git-chglog) to generate changelogs from Git commits, using [git-chglog](https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog).
* [Git Info](./git-info) to extract information from a Git repository.
* [GitLab CLI](./gitlab-cli) to interact with GitLab.
* [Crane](./crane) to interact with container registries through the [Crane CLI](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/cmd/crane).
* [JX Release Version](./jx-release-version) to automate semver releases, using [Jenkins X Release Version](https://github.com/jenkins-x-plugins/jx-release-version).

You can see the documentation of these modules in their own README files, or in the [Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev/search?q=vbehar).
